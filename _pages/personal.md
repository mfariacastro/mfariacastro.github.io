# Personal

I'm originally from the [Azores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azores), a Portuguese archipelago in the North Atlantic.

I live in the Tower Grove area of St. Louis with [my partner](https://www.deidraoloughlin.com/), our two daughters, and our cat.

When Im not working or parenting, I enjoy (and often read about):
* cooking & wine
* running
* art history & architecture
* vexillology - I'm a member of [NAVA](https://www.nava.org/) and have contributed to its publications
* [Magic: The Gathering](https://moxfield.com/users/mfariacastro)
* science/speculative fiction - my favorite authors are [Gene Wolfe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_Wolfe) and [Ursula Le Guin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ursula_K._Le_Guin)
