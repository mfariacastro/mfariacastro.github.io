# Notes
As a student, I wrote notes for the third quarter of the Macroeconomics Ph.D. core sequence at NYU, taught by Professor Ricardo Lagos. These notes have not been revised for a long time and may contain (my) mistakes, so use them at your own discretion.

The material covered is: asset pricing; classical monetary theory; search and matching in a labor context; and an introduction to optimal taxation. You can download these notes [here](https://18798-presscdn-pagely.netdna-ssl.com/mfcastro/wp-content/uploads/sites/1933/2015/05/notes_macro_oct2012.pdf).
