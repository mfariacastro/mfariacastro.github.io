## Notes

As a student, I wrote notes for the **third quarter of the NYU Ph.D. Macroeconomics core sequence**, taught by **Ricardo Lagos**. These notes have not been revised in a long time and may contain errors—please use them with that caveat in mind.

The notes cover: **asset pricing**, **classical monetary theory**, **search and matching in labor markets**, and an **introduction to optimal taxation**.
